# Generated Salesforce Clients

These clients will be auto-generated based on your salesforce configuration in `step_04` and `step_12`.

Note: included are some generic generated files based off of generic salesforce NPSP configuration, just to allow for builds to pass.

These are included for build-purposes only. You'll need to run `step_04` and `step_12` to generate clients
that are specific to your use cases (including your custom objects, settings, and enums).
